# Introduction
iPhones are known for their robust security features [[1]](#references), however the sheer number of settings available can make exploring and understanding these features challenging. 

This guide outlines a collection of privacy and security settings to consider. There is no one-size-fits-all collection of recommended settings - the best settings for you depend on your personal preferences and how you use your iPhone [[[2]](#references)].


# Essential Settings

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Apple ID. It requires a verification code in addition to your password when signing in to your Apple ID on a new device or browser. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access. 

To enable 2FA:
1. Go to **Settings** > **[your name]** > **Sign-in & Security**.
2. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and follow the prompts to set it up.

## Use a Strong Passcode
Ensure that your iPhone is protected with a strong passcode. 

To change your passcode:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Face (or Touch) ID & Passcode** or **Face ID & Passcode**.
2. Tap **Change Passcode** and enter your current passcode.

## Audit App Permissions
Regularly review the permissions granted to apps on your iPhone. To check app permissions:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
2. Review each category (e.g., Location Services, Contacts, Photos, Microphone, etc) and adjust permissions for each app as necessary.


Consider limiting access to sensitive data and features unless absolutely necessary. 
 
 You can also use the **Privacy Report** feature to see which apps have accessed your data recently.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Privacy Report**.

## Disable ad tracking
To limit ad tracking and improve your privacy, you can disable personalized ads:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Apple Advertising**. Toggle off **Personalized Ads**.   
2. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Tracking** and toggle off **Allow Apps to Request to Track**.
   
This will prevent apps from asking for permission to track you across other apps and websites.

## Enable Find My iPhone
Find My iPhone helps you locate your device if it's lost or stolen. To enable it:
1. Go to **Settings** > **[your name]** > **Find My**.
2. Tap **Find My iPhone** and toggle it on.
3. Optionally, enable **Send Last Location** to automatically send the last known location of your iPhone when the battery is low.

Once enabled, if you lose a device or it’s stolen, you can find it on a map, or more importantly, remotely wipe its contents [[3]](#references).

## Enable Stolen Device Protection
Stolen Device Protection is designed specifically for situations where someone steals your phone and knows your passcode. This can happen if you’ve shared your passcode with someone, or if a person looks over your shoulder when you unlock your phone.

Stolen Device Protection attempts to mitigate the damage from a thief getting their hands on your phone. It does this by putting a timer on making any major alterations to your accounts, like changing your Apple Account password.

To enable this feature:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Face (or Touch) ID & Passcode** > **Stolen Device Protection**.
2. Toggle on **Stolen Device Protection.**

You will see two options underneath Require Security Delay: **Away from Familiar Locations** and **Always**. 

With **Away from Familiar Locations** enabled, the Stolen Device Protection will not be enabled when you’re at any Significant Location. **Note**: This won't work if you turned off Significant Locations in the Location privacy section.

# Additional Settings

## Enable Advanced Data Protection
Advanced Data Protection provides end-to-end encryption for your iCloud data. 

To enable it: 
1. Go to **Settings** > **[your name]** > **iCloud** > **Advanced Data Protection**.
2. Follow the prompts to enable it.
3. This feature encrypts your iCloud data, including backups, photos, and notes, ensuring that only you can access it.

Note that enabling this feature may require you to set up a recovery key or recovery contact. Make sure to keep your recovery key or contact information secure, as losing access to it may result in permanent loss of access to your data.


## Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode [[4]](#references) is an extreme security feature designed to protect against cyber attacks. When Lockdown Mode is enabled, apps, websites and funtionalities will be limited and some features will be disabled completely.  

To enable Lockdown Mode:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Lockdown Mode**.
2. Tap **Turn On Lockdown Mode** and follow the prompts to enable it.


## Safety Check
Safety Check is a feature that allows you to quickly review and manage the access you've granted to others, including location sharing and app permissions. 

To use Safety Check:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Safety Check**.
2. Here you have two different options:
- **Emergency Reset**: This option allows you to quickly revoke access to all apps and services that you've shared with others. It will also stop location sharing and remove any emergency contacts.
- **Manage Sharing and Access**: This option allows you to review and adjust the permissions you've granted to others. You can see which apps have access to your location, photos, and other data, and you can revoke access as needed.


## Mail privacy protection
Mail Privacy Protection is a feature that helps protect your email privacy by preventing senders from knowing when you open their emails or tracking your IP address. 

To enable it mail privacy protection:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Mail** > **Privacy Protection**.
2. Toggle on **Protect Mail Activity**.

## Safari Settings
You can increase your privacy while browsing the web by adjusting Safari settings:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Safari**.
 - Change your default search engine to a privacy-focused option like DuckDuckGo.
 - Enable **Prevent Cross-Site Tracking** to block third-party cookies and trackers.
 - Enable **Hide IP Address** to hide your IP address from trackers and websites.

## Obscure Lockscreen Notifications
To prevent sensitive information from being displayed on your lock screen, you can adjust your notification settings:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications** >> **Show Previews**.
2. Select **When Unlocked** to hide sensitive information on the lock screen.
   
You can also choose to turn off notifications for specific apps entirely.

## Disable iCloud Backups
You may not want every app to back up its data to iCloud. To disable iCloud backups for specific apps:
1. Go to **Settings** > **[your name]** > **iCloud**
2. Next to **Saved to iCloud**, tap on **See All**
3. Find the app you want to disable and toggle it off. 
 
You can also disable iCloud backups entirely by toggling off **iCloud Backup**.

## Adjust Siri Settings
Siri has access to various data on your iPhone, including contacts, messages, and location. To limit Siri's access to your data, you can adjust its settings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Siri**.
2. Under **Siri App Access**, click on **Apps**, and disable any apps you don't want Siri to access [hobbit-hole][5].
